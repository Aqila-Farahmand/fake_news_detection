of promises on the campaign trail but ever since election night he has backed away from many of them or broken them entirely first  trump didn t  drain the swamp   his cabinet is set to be the wealthiest in history and most of his picks are washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe and many conservatives now realize that trump is going to help republicans wipe out medicare  medicaid  and social security  programs trump repeatedly swore to leave intact trump will also not prosecute hillary clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead so  many of trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on election day and are expressing that regret on social media  and luckily for us  a tumblr site known as trumpgrets is collecting all of their right wing tears for our viewing entertainment and there are plenty more where those came from voting for donald trump is the biggest regret that    americans will have to live with for the rest of their lives  they will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity  but trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets  millions more simply stayed at home or voted for a third party that had no chance of actually winning  and now america is paying the price for it the truly sad thing is that trump hasn t even taken office yet  so we can only imagine how much more people will regret their choice as these next four years drag on

    \"patrick henningsen  century wireas baron rothschild famously said back in the late  century   when there s blood in the streets  it s time to buy property   too bad then that donald trump has to divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust  on the scale of ugly  last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards both marco rubio and ted cruz began their two hour long sustained attack on the man in the middle  donald trump   relentlessly hitting the front runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle  trump hit back at cruz calling him  a liar  and at rubio calling the florida senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of chris christie during the last televised debate  war  gop rival marco rubio tearing into donald trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals clearly  cnn was also part of this coordinated attack  as they echoed wall street luminary and former presidential candidate mitt romney  going after trump about publicly releasing his tax returns  trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the irs and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit  which is actually true   and cnn  along with cruz  kept hammering the issue straight into the post debate media opportunity where cnn ing nue chris cuomo tried  and failed  to channel his inner tim russert as he continued the trump tax probe it didn t end there  subsequent gang stalking by rubio and cruz were powered by the new york times  who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti trump editorial stance early on   including accusations of fraud over the trump university civil court case  trump using polish building labor in   the same year that rubio and cruz were beginning second grade   and accusations of hypocrisy over trump s use of used h  visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south florida  that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though  trump  a seasoned litigator  didn t seemed too worried about the trump university case  intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that   and the polish builder scandal  come on guys  who doesn t like polish builders   happened  years ago forget about airs and graces  this was a vicious battle   a historic new low for american politics  the fact trump survived the beating was something in itself  if he does make it through this storm  then both cruz and rubio will have done the donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage  and leaving hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come august when today s morning press came out  exactly as they have throughout this election  all of the mainstream media channels  newspapers and magazine loudly declared trump s  debate defeat   and trumpeted rubio  aggressiveness   liberal establishment stalwart the atlantic declared   trump s terrible night   while nbc news ran with the headline that  rubio and cruz hammer trump   followed by the washington post trumpeting   rubio won debate  put trump on the defensive  other wishful pundits weighed in  like media mogul glenn beck  who is openly backing ted cruz and warning his audiences of an end times armageddon if america doesn t elect a  true christian conservative  in november   beck was ecstatic after rubio s debate performance  especially after this week when trump gatecrashed a nevada event where beck was stumping for cruz rubio is killing it  gopdebate  glenn beck   glennbeck  february    morning  rubio drew additional fire from the trump centcom after rubio claimed that donald trump had received   million from his father  and said if not for his father s  inheritance   trump would be  selling watches in manhattan  this morning rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into trump  calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart trump s spelling mistakes on twitter  at this point  you just got the feeling that rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse  as the old saying goes  never wrestle with a pig in the end  it was trump who stole the wind from rubio s sails  when early the following morning he appeared on national tv next to firebrand gop candidate  chris christie  garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular new jersey governor  rent a crowd  critics have pointed out that rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera  as seen at this morning s rubio rally in texas crowds for hire with so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media  politicians are said to be turning to pr agencies and  rent a crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences  more than any other previous presidential election cycle  this  race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at gop candidates like jeb bush   but also towards marco rubio  at this morning s media event  rubio s team had hand picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below rubio  interestingly  the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and rubio   they simply smile  and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in texas  even hip hop gangster looking students wearing color coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote  appear disinterested  as if they are being paid   to stand in a row in the camera frame if this is any indication of rubio s  new american century   then it s certainly cause for worry  the fact that rubio stole his campaign slogan from donald rumsfeld and john bolton s neoconservative pro war think tank  project for a new american century  pnac  is interesting  and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect ironically  it was the brash hawk donald trump who took the high ground on the issue of the middle east  when asked about his commitment to israel  trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the israelis and the palestinians  and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that   it would be my greatest achievement as us president   who can really argue with that  well  hermanos cubanos did  cruz and rubio were furious at this point  and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the israeli lobby to maintain a categorically anti palestinian stance  cruz and rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange  both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the middle east on their watch  once again  cruz and rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want almost one year ago i said on the sunday wire show that the republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the white house more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be marco rubio  with wisconsin s scott walker throwing early innings in the bull pen  orthodox rnc thinking last spring believed that with rubio  with less than one term in senate and no leadership experience  could somehow repeat the  obama effect  of  and finally usher their party into the  century  things looked very different for hillary last spring too  where she seemed invincible on the democrat side as well as in national polling  on paper at least  it seems that rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the gop elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young   years old  although you d punt him at a decade his junior   and even more importantly he s latino  which gives the gop a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment  hispanic american  independents and moderate democrats  on paper this all makes perfect sense  but running for president in the united states of america isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper  case and point  bernie sanders  ben carson and  of course  donald trump curtainsif cruz loses his home state texas gop primary on march   then it s lights out for the cruz campaign  right now cruz and trump are in a dead heat  nearly tied in the pre polling  with cruz a few points ahead  ditto for rubio in his home state florida s gop primary on march   currently  trump is burying rubio by an average of   points in every poll for florida  birther issues aside  this has always been the knock against both rafael edward  ted  cruz  photo  left  and marco rubio  just like barack obama  they are too young and with no real experience governing  and like obama  destined to become party functionaries trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in manhattan  both cruz and rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high  putting this into perspective  it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring america   like him or hate him  trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships  and has actually created jobs  as much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation   the truth is that americans no longer believe this lie  and millions now see donald j  trump as the antidote to that institutional fib  if you polled americans today and asked them  would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy      it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything  trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him  it s not a theoretical proposition  in essence this is the american dream  and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians rubio and cruz  and perhaps for hillary clinton too  should she face off against trump later on despite the mainstream media insistence that marco rubio  won  thursday night s debate  and  ted cruz looked  strong   it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes  in effect  trying to out trump the donald  if that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over inflated political marketing exercises  their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers  but in the end it didn t make the cuban pair look presidential  at this stage of the race  looking presidential is important  but when you re desperately playing catch up you simply can t afford to look presidential  according to rubio and cruz anyway  just another example of how short term logic rules this race meanwhile  the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic  think of all the retractions and back pedaling if trump wins  as trump continues to win primaries and scoop up delegates on his way towards a republican nomination watch rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in texas    it was amusing to watch cnn interrogators  along with rubio and cruz  lay into trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan  trump stuck to his canned lines  and generalities  and lost no ground with his supporters either  it should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either  as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises  eight years of obama taught america that lesson once and for all throughout the cnn event  trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry  the fact of the matter here is  despite painting themselves as rebels and  dc outsiders   both rubio and cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various washington dc lobbies  the same special interests have poured fortunes into super pacs which are presently funding cruz and rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar tv ad slots  trump  on the other hand  is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for collectively  between scott walker  jeb bush  rick perry  john kasich  marco rubio and ted cruz  hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated  invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated gop field   and give lift off to each one of these political balloons  as it stands now  all of this money will have been spent in vain  the only winners will be the media consultants and pr companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material  and also the tv networks  like cnn  fox and the others  who ran all of those costly political ads towards the end of cnn s gladiatorial event last night  trump got the last word  and again  it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base  he exclaimed  politicians are all talk  no action   just like these two here  cruz and rubio   look what s happening to our country  trade  vets  common core  obamacare  i ll get it done  they won t  and we will make america great again  once again  it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says  or like everything he does  just as jimmy carter was to cure for nixon s epic corruption  and the simple jack approach of george w  bush was the beneficiary of bill clinton s shameful antics in the oval office  and just as barack obama was the natural reaction to the nation s wmd shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of george w  bush   so too is donald trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer in chief politics by barack obama if trump does win the nomination in july  then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in american history   the real fun has only just begun read more election news at

wealthiest in history and most of his picks are washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe and many conservatives now realize that trump is going to help republicans wipe out medicare  medicaid  and social security  programs trump repeatedly swore to leave intact trump will also not prosecute hillary clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead so  many of trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on election day and are expressing that regret on social media  and luckily for us  a tumblr site known as trumpgrets is collecting all of their right wing tears for our viewing entertainment and there are plenty more where those came from voting for donald trump is the biggest regret that    americans will have to live with for the rest of their lives  they will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity  but trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets  millions more simply stayed at home or voted for a third party that had no chance of actually winning  and now america is paying the price for it the truly sad thing is that trump hasn t even taken office yet  so we can only imagine how much more people will regret their choice as these next four years drag on

divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust  on the scale of ugly  last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards both marco rubio and ted cruz began their two hour long sustained attack on the man in the middle  donald trump   relentlessly hitting the front runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle  trump hit back at cruz calling him  a liar  and at rubio calling the florida senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of chris christie during the last televised debate  war  gop rival marco rubio tearing into donald trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals clearly  cnn was also part of this coordinated attack  as they echoed wall street luminary and former presidential candidate mitt romney  going after trump about publicly releasing his tax returns  trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the irs and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit  which is actually true   and cnn  along with cruz  kept hammering the issue straight into the post debate media opportunity where cnn ing nue chris cuomo tried  and failed  to channel his inner tim russert as he continued the trump tax probe it didn t end there  subsequent gang stalking by rubio and cruz were powered by the new york times  who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti trump editorial stance early on   including accusations of fraud over the trump university civil court case  trump using polish building labor in   the same year that rubio and cruz were beginning second grade   and accusations of hypocrisy over trump s use of used h  visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south florida  that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though  trump  a seasoned litigator  didn t seemed too worried about the trump university case  intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that   and the polish builder scandal  come on guys  who doesn t like polish builders   happened  years ago forget about airs and graces  this was a vicious battle   a historic new low for american politics  the fact trump survived the beating was something in itself  if he does make it through this storm  then both cruz and rubio will have done the donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage  and leaving hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come august when today s morning press came out  exactly as they have throughout this election  all of the mainstream media channels  newspapers and magazine loudly declared trump s  debate defeat   and trumpeted rubio  aggressiveness   liberal establishment stalwart the atlantic declared   trump s terrible night   while nbc news ran with the headline that  rubio and cruz hammer trump   followed by the washington post trumpeting   rubio won debate  put trump on the defensive  other wishful pundits weighed in  like media mogul glenn beck  who is openly backing ted cruz and warning his audiences of an end times armageddon if america doesn t elect a  true christian conservative  in november   beck was ecstatic after rubio s debate performance  especially after this week when trump gatecrashed a nevada event where beck was stumping for cruz rubio is killing it  gopdebate  glenn beck   glennbeck  february    morning  rubio drew additional fire from the trump centcom after rubio claimed that donald trump had received   million from his father  and said if not for his father s  inheritance   trump would be  selling watches in manhattan  this morning rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into trump  calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart trump s spelling mistakes on twitter  at this point  you just got the feeling that rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse  as the old saying goes  never wrestle with a pig in the end  it was trump who stole the wind from rubio s sails  when early the following morning he appeared on national tv next to firebrand gop candidate  chris christie  garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular new jersey governor  rent a crowd  critics have pointed out that rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera  as seen at this morning s rubio rally in texas crowds for hire with so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media  politicians are said to be turning to pr agencies and  rent a crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences  more than any other previous presidential election cycle  this  race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at gop candidates like jeb bush   but also towards marco rubio  at this morning s media event  rubio s team had hand picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below rubio  interestingly  the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and rubio   they simply smile  and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in texas  even hip hop gangster looking students wearing color coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote  appear disinterested  as if they are being paid   to stand in a row in the camera frame if this is any indication of rubio s  new american century   then it s certainly cause for worry  the fact that rubio stole his campaign slogan from donald rumsfeld and john bolton s neoconservative pro war think tank  project for a new american century  pnac  is interesting  and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect ironically  it was the brash hawk donald trump who took the high ground on the issue of the middle east  when asked about his commitment to israel  trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the israelis and the palestinians  and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that   it would be my greatest achievement as us president   who can really argue with that  well  hermanos cubanos did  cruz and rubio were furious at this point  and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the israeli lobby to maintain a categorically anti palestinian stance  cruz and rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange  both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the middle east on their watch  once again  cruz and rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want almost one year ago i said on the sunday wire show that the republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the white house more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be marco rubio  with wisconsin s scott walker throwing early innings in the bull pen  orthodox rnc thinking last spring believed that with rubio  with less than one term in senate and no leadership experience  could somehow repeat the  obama effect  of  and finally usher their party into the  century  things looked very different for hillary last spring too  where she seemed invincible on the democrat side as well as in national polling  on paper at least  it seems that rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the gop elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young   years old  although you d punt him at a decade his junior   and even more importantly he s latino  which gives the gop a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment  hispanic american  independents and moderate democrats  on paper this all makes perfect sense  but running for president in the united states of america isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper  case and point  bernie sanders  ben carson and  of course  donald trump curtainsif cruz loses his home state texas gop primary on march   then it s lights out for the cruz campaign  right now cruz and trump are in a dead heat  nearly tied in the pre polling  with cruz a few points ahead  ditto for rubio in his home state florida s gop primary on march   currently  trump is burying rubio by an average of   points in every poll for florida  birther issues aside  this has always been the knock against both rafael edward  ted  cruz  photo  left  and marco rubio  just like barack obama  they are too young and with no real experience governing  and like obama  destined to become party functionaries trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in manhattan  both cruz and rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high  putting this into perspective  it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring america   like him or hate him  trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships  and has actually created jobs  as much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation   the truth is that americans no longer believe this lie  and millions now see donald j  trump as the antidote to that institutional fib  if you polled americans today and asked them  would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy      it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything  trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him  it s not a theoretical proposition  in essence this is the american dream  and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians rubio and cruz  and perhaps for hillary clinton too  should she face off against trump later on despite the mainstream media insistence that marco rubio  won  thursday night s debate  and  ted cruz looked  strong   it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes  in effect  trying to out trump the donald  if that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over inflated political marketing exercises  their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers  but in the end it didn t make the cuban pair look presidential  at this stage of the race  looking presidential is important  but when you re desperately playing catch up you simply can t afford to look presidential  according to rubio and cruz anyway  just another example of how short term logic rules this race meanwhile  the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic  think of all the retractions and back pedaling if trump wins  as trump continues to win primaries and scoop up delegates on his way towards a republican nomination watch rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in texas    it was amusing to watch cnn interrogators  along with rubio and cruz  lay into trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan  trump stuck to his canned lines  and generalities  and lost no ground with his supporters either  it should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either  as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises  eight years of obama taught america that lesson once and for all throughout the cnn event  trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry  the fact of the matter here is  despite painting themselves as rebels and  dc outsiders   both rubio and cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various washington dc lobbies  the same special interests have poured fortunes into super pacs which are presently funding cruz and rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar tv ad slots  trump  on the other hand  is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for collectively  between scott walker  jeb bush  rick perry  john kasich  marco rubio and ted cruz  hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated  invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated gop field   and give lift off to each one of these political balloons  as it stands now  all of this money will have been spent in vain  the only winners will be the media consultants and pr companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material  and also the tv networks  like cnn  fox and the others  who ran all of those costly political ads towards the end of cnn s gladiatorial event last night  trump got the last word  and again  it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base  he exclaimed  politicians are all talk  no action   just like these two here  cruz and rubio   look what s happening to our country  trade  vets  common core  obamacare  i ll get it done  they won t  and we will make america great again  once again  it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says  or like everything he does  just as jimmy carter was to cure for nixon s epic corruption  and the simple jack approach of george w  bush was the beneficiary of bill clinton s shameful antics in the oval office  and just as barack obama was the natural reaction to the nation s wmd shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of george w  bush   so too is donald trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer in chief politics by barack obama if trump does win the nomination in july  then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in american history   the real fun has only just begun read more election news at

wealthiest in history and most of his picks are washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe and many conservatives now realize that trump is going to help republicans wipe out medicare  medicaid  and social security  programs trump repeatedly swore to leave intact trump will also not prosecute hillary clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the mexican border

biggest regret that    americans will have to live with for the rest of their lives  they will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity  but trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets  millions more simply stayed at home or voted for a third party that had no chance of actually winning  and now america is paying the price for it the truly sad thing is that trump hasn t even taken office yet  so we can only imagine how much more people will regret their choice as these next four years drag on

    \"patrick henningsen  century wireas baron rothschild famously said back in the late  century   when there s blood in the streets  it s time to buy property   too bad then that donald trump has to divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust  on the scale of ugly  last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards both marco rubio and ted cruz began their two hour long sustained attack on the man in the middle  donald trump   relentlessly hitting the front runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle  trump hit back at cruz calling him  a liar  and at rubio calling the florida senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of chris christie during the last televised debate  war  gop rival marco rubio tearing into donald trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals clearly  cnn was also part of this coordinated attack  as they echoed wall street luminary and former presidential candidate mitt romney  going after trump about publicly releasing his tax returns  trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the irs and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit  which is actually true   and cnn  along with cruz  kept hammering the issue straight into the post debate media opportunity where cnn ing nue chris cuomo tried  and failed  to channel his inner tim russert as he continued the trump tax probe it didn t end there  subsequent gang stalking by rubio and cruz were powered by the new york times  who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti trump editorial stance early on   including accusations of fraud over the trump university civil court case  trump using polish building labor in   the same year that rubio and cruz were beginning second grade   and accusations of hypocrisy over trump s use of used h  visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south florida  that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though  trump  a seasoned litigator  didn t seemed too worried about the trump university case  intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that   and the polish builder scandal  come on guys  who doesn t like polish builders   happened  years ago forget about airs and graces  this was a vicious battle   a historic new low for american politics  the fact trump survived the beating was something in itself  if he does make it through this storm  then both cruz and rubio will have done the donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage  and leaving hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come august when today s morning press came out  exactly as they have throughout this election  all of the mainstream media channels  newspapers and magazine loudly declared trump s  debate defeat   and trumpeted rubio  aggressiveness   liberal establishment stalwart the atlantic declared   trump s terrible night   while nbc news ran with the headline that  rubio and cruz hammer trump   followed by the washington post trumpeting   rubio won debate  put trump on the defensive  other wishful pundits weighed in  like media mogul glenn beck  who is openly backing ted cruz and warning his audiences of an end times armageddon if america doesn t elect a  true christian conservative  in november   beck was ecstatic after rubio s debate performance  especially after this week when trump gatecrashed a nevada event where beck was stumping for cruz rubio is killing it  gopdebate  glenn beck   glennbeck  february    morning  rubio drew additional fire from the trump centcom after rubio claimed that donald trump had received   million from his father  and said if not for his father s  inheritance   trump would be  selling watches in manhattan  this morning rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into trump  calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart trump s spelling mistakes on twitter  at this point  you just got the feeling that rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse  as the old saying goes  never wrestle with a pig in the end  it was trump who stole the wind from rubio s sails  when early the following morning he appeared on national tv next to firebrand gop candidate  chris christie  garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular new jersey governor  rent a crowd  critics have pointed out that rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera  as seen at this morning s rubio rally in texas crowds for hire with so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media  politicians are said to be turning to pr agencies and  rent a crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences  more than any other previous presidential election cycle  this  race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at gop candidates like jeb bush   but also towards marco rubio  at this morning s media event  rubio s team had hand picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below rubio  interestingly  the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and rubio   they simply smile  and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in texas  even hip hop gangster looking students wearing color coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote  appear disinterested  as if they are being paid   to stand in a row in the camera frame if this is any indication of rubio s  new american century   then it s certainly cause for worry  the fact that rubio stole his campaign slogan from donald rumsfeld and john bolton s neoconservative pro war think tank  project for a new american century  pnac  is interesting  and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect ironically  it was the brash hawk donald trump who took the high ground on the issue of the middle east  when asked about his commitment to israel  trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the israelis and the palestinians  and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that   it would be my greatest achievement as us president   who can really argue with that  well  hermanos cubanos did  cruz and rubio were furious at this point  and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the israeli lobby to maintain a categorically anti palestinian stance  cruz and rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange  both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the middle east on their watch  once again  cruz and rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want almost one year ago i said on the sunday wire show that the republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the white house more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be marco rubio  with wisconsin s scott walker throwing early innings in the bull pen  orthodox rnc thinking last spring believed that with rubio  with less than one term in senate and no leadership experience  could somehow repeat the  obama effect  of  and finally usher their party into the  century  things looked very different for hillary last spring too  where she seemed invincible on the democrat side as well as in national polling  on paper at least  it seems that rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the gop elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young   years old  although you d punt him at a decade his junior   and even more importantly he s latino  which gives the gop a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment  hispanic american  independents and moderate democrats  on paper this all makes perfect sense  but running for president in the united states of america isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper  case and point  bernie sanders  ben carson and  of course  donald trump curtainsif cruz loses his home state texas gop primary on march   then it s lights out for the cruz campaign  right now cruz and trump are in a dead heat  nearly tied in the pre polling  with cruz a few points ahead  ditto for rubio in his home state florida s gop primary on march   currently  trump is burying rubio by an average of   points in every poll for florida  birther issues aside  this has always been the knock against both rafael edward  ted  cruz  photo  left  and marco rubio  just like barack obama  they are too young and with no real experience governing  and like obama  destined to become party functionaries trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in manhattan  both cruz and rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high  putting this into perspective  it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring america   like him or hate him  trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships  and has actually created jobs  as much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation   the truth is that americans no longer believe this lie  and millions now see donald j  trump as the antidote to that institutional fib  if you polled americans today and asked them  would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy      it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything  trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him  it s not a theoretical proposition  in essence this is the american dream  and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians rubio and cruz  and perhaps for hillary clinton too  should she face off against trump later on despite the mainstream media insistence that marco rubio  won  thursday night s debate  and  ted cruz looked  strong   it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes  in effect  trying to out trump the donald  if that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over inflated political marketing exercises  their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers  but in the end it didn t make the cuban pair look presidential  at this stage of the race  looking presidential is important  but when you re desperately playing catch up you simply can t afford to look presidential  according to rubio and cruz anyway  just another example of how short term logic rules this race meanwhile  the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic  think of all the retractions and back pedaling if trump wins  as trump continues to win primaries and scoop up delegates on his way towards a republican nomination watch rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in texas    it was amusing to watch cnn interrogators  along with rubio and cruz  lay into trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan  trump stuck to his canned lines  and generalities  and lost no ground with his supporters either  it should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either  as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises  eight years of obama taught america that lesson once and for all throughout the cnn event  trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry  the fact of the matter here is  despite painting themselves as rebels and  dc outsiders   both rubio and cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various washington dc lobbies  the same special interests have poured fortunes into super pacs which are presently funding cruz and rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar tv ad slots  trump  on the other hand  is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for collectively  between scott walker  jeb bush  rick perry  john kasich  marco rubio and ted cruz  hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated  invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated gop field   and give lift off to each one of these political balloons  as it stands now  all of this money will have been spent in vain  the only winners will be the media consultants and pr companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material  and also the tv networks  like cnn  fox and the others  who ran all of those costly political ads towards the end of cnn s gladiatorial event last night  trump got the last word  and again  it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base  he exclaimed  politicians are all talk  no action   just like these two here  cruz and rubio   look what s happening to our country  trade  vets  common core  obamacare  i ll get it done  they won t  and we will make america great again  once again  it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says  or like everything he does  just as jimmy carter was to cure for nixon s epic corruption  and the simple jack approach of george w  bush was the beneficiary of bill clinton s shameful antics in the oval office  and just as barack obama was the natural reaction to the nation s wmd shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of george w  bush   so too is donald trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer in chief politics by barack obama if trump does win the nomination in july  then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in american history   the real fun has only just begun read more election news at

speaking at an appropriations committee meeting  did not say how much funding would be in the proposal  the republican said it would supplement the white house reallocation   we recognize that there is an urgency associated with the threat   cochran said   this proposal will provide new resources     it is my expectation that this proposal will be offered to an appropriations measure on the senate floor in the near future   senator barbara mikulski  the senior democrat on the panel  said lawmakers must act before july    we are in a race against the clock  we are in a race with the mosquitoes and right now i would say that the mosquitoes are winning   zika was first detected in brazil last year and linked to a spike in the birth defect microcephaly  a condition defined by unusually small heads that can hamper development  as well as the rare autoimmune disorder guillain barre syndrome in adults  u s  health officials say local outbreaks are possible in the continental united states once the weather warms  particularly in southern states such as florida  but mosquitoes that carry the virus could spread further north  cochran said it had been difficult to obtain the information necessary to thoroughly evaluate the obama administration s zika funding request  a complaint also raised by republicans in the house of representatives   several senators  including democrat patty murray and republican roy blunt  are working on the proposal  cochran said  blunt told the panel that he and murray were largely in agreement and he looked forward to working on the matter over the next few days   i believe we are closing in on a number that is the right number   he said  without elaborating  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

appropriations committee chairman thad cochran said on thursday  democrats and obama administration officials have urged the republican controlled congress to grant nearly    billion in emergency funds to combat zika  a virus borne by mosquitoes that can cause microcephaly  a rare birth defect  but many republicans have said they need more information from the administration before approving the measure   in a temporary fix  the white house said earlier this month it would reprogram   million of allocated funds  but said this would be insufficient to deal with the threat  cochran  speaking at an appropriations committee meeting  did not say how much funding would be in the proposal  the republican said it would supplement the white house reallocation   we recognize that there

information necessary to thoroughly evaluate the obama administration s zika funding request  a complaint also raised by republicans in the house of representatives   several senators  including democrat patty murray and republican roy blunt  are working on the proposal  cochran said  blunt told the panel that he and murray were largely in agreement and he looked forward to working on the

its government proceeds with an effort to elect a legislative body that critics call a plan to create a dictatorship  republican senator marco rubio  who has worked closely with president donald trump s administration on latin american issues  held a news conference with two other republican members of congress  all from florida  to discuss the issue ahead of the controversial vote in venezuela on sunday  julio borges  who leads venezuela s opposition led national assembly legislature  telephoned in to the news conference to discuss the vote  rubio noted that the trump administration had announced sanctions this week  and added   you can expect more   the trump administration imposed sanctions on  senior venezuelan officials on wednesday  heaping pressure on unpopular president nicolas maduro to scrap plans for the new congress  a senior trump administration official told reuters this week that the administration would make good on trump s threat to take action and would act  very quickly  on further sanctions if maduro goes ahead with his plan  another lawmaker at the news conference  u s  representative mario diaz balart  said he hoped maduro will  take a deep breath  and back off   if they don t  the united states will not stand still   he said  rubio insisted the united states was not seeking to dictate to venezuela   what unifies us today in this cause isn t interference in another country s affairs  but support for its people   he said  rubio said secretary of the treasury steve mnuchin had been involved in the issue  and that trump had spoken to secretary of state rex tillerson about venezuela this week  rubio said he had spoken to trump three times this month about venezuela and that he had spoken to vice president mike pence about it on thursday and earlier in the week as well   there is high level engagement throughout this administration on this issue   rubio said  \",\n          \"washington  reuters    president donald trump s pledge to bring massive investments in u s  infrastructure projects showed new signs of life on friday after lying dormant for weeks  as leading republican lawmakers said proposals from the administration could be in the offing  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  told reporters he expects to receive  some kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill  a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis   but gave no details or timing  he has previously voiced concern over adding to budget deficits with a new injection of federal funds for road  bridge and other construction projects like the ones president barack obama secured from congress in   especially after a major highway funding law was enacted about a year ago  some republicans and democrats in congress are increasingly criticizing trump s administration for being slow to get behind his legislative initiatives during the first month of his presidency  trump s plans to create an infrastructure council led by two new york billionaire friends  developers richard lefrak and steven roth  have yet to be launched  a spokesman for lefrak said   during his presidential campaign  trump said he would push for a   trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads  bridges  airports and other public works projects  he said he wanted action during the first  days of his administration  which now seems unlikely  the republican president has talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment in many of these projects  but democrats say that would fail to spur enough rebuilding and put taxpayers on the hook for a tax credit to wealthy developers  who they said would build toll roads that taxpayers would then have to pay to use  democrats want a more direct federal role in sparking a construction boom  in an interview on tuesday  republican representative mario diaz balart said he had  no doubt that it  infrastructure investment  is a priority for the administration   diaz balart chairs a house subcommittee that would control the flow of washington money that might be needed to fund some of the public works projects  several lawmakers and aides speculated the initiative could be attached to tax reform legislation that republicans want to advance this year  but no decisions have been made  writing an infrastructure bill involves seven or eight committees  there are complicated tax and spending questions at stake  and lawmakers are divided  there are also questions over what would qualify as an infrastructure project  with rural areas  for example  clamoring for more broadband internet service  senator john thune  a member of the republican leadership who chairs the commerce and transportation panel which has a say on any bill  said he had little information on the content or status of legislation  asked about mcconnell s comments  thune said   maybe he knows more about it since he s married to the secretary of

clinton campaign and dnc in negative lights writing for newswars  jerome corsi notes at a hearing of the senate judiciary committee subcommittee on crime and terrorism on tuesday  sean edgett  acting general counsel for twitter  admitted in his prepared testimony that twitter employed in the  election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical  of  hillary clinton  including the hashtag  podestaemails and the hashtag  dncleaks  is anyone surprised twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even usa today brought it up  noting that twitter s behind the scenes team was quick to ban right wingers like milo yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever so entertaining actress leslie jones yet  conservatives say  nothing happened to rapper talib kweli and his followers when they attacked black breitbart reporter jerome hudson with racial slurs  when breitbart contributor kassy dillon complained about a twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages  twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot dillon in the head  now  the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to hrc and the dnc during the  election  the twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people  one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place  but that s a different matter   but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise for example  dr  corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the judiciary committee  edgett stated for example  our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated tweets promoting the  podestaemails hashtag  which originated with wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the clinton campaign chairman john podesta s gmail account  the core of the hashtag was propagated by wikileaks  whose account sent out a series of  original tweets containing variants on the hashtag  podestaemails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the wikileaks website so  automatically  what mr  edgett has admitted tells us that twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user  wikileaks  offering authentic information that wikileaks had published revealing real  confirmed e mails sourced from john podesta and the dnc  those e mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the dnc that worked against bernie sanders  campaign  and in favor of mrs  clinton s campaign  and later revealed extremely important information about what mrs  clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of syria and the underlying  unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of qaddafi in libya edgett also testified that twitter hid   of the   podestaemails  tweets  andas described in greater detail below  our systems detected and hid just under half     of the tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag   dncleak  which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the democratic national committee  those would be the e mails that revealed towering corruption at the dnc and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the clinton campaign to offer her easy questions  things like donna brazile  then an employee of cnn  feeding hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman  bernie sanders these are issues that were real  and the more people knew about them  the more they disliked mrs  clinton   and the more she and the dnc hackmeisters pushed the spurious  russia hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance for entire story  mrctv \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

its government proceeds with an effort to elect a legislative body that critics call a plan to create a dictatorship  republican senator marco rubio  who has worked closely with president donald trump s administration on latin american issues  held a news conference with two other republican members of congress  all from florida  to discuss the issue ahead of the controversial vote in venezuela on sunday  julio borges  who leads venezuela s opposition led national assembly legislature  telephoned in to the news conference to discuss the vote  rubio noted that the trump administration had announced sanctions this week  and added   you can expect more   the trump administration imposed sanctions on  senior venezuelan officials on wednesday  heaping pressure on unpopular president nicolas maduro to scrap plans for the new congress  a senior trump administration official told reuters this week that the administration would make good on trump s threat to take action and would act  very quickly  on further sanctions if maduro goes ahead with his plan  another lawmaker at the news conference  u s  representative mario diaz balart  said he hoped maduro will  take a deep breath  and back off   if they don t  the united states will not stand still   he said  rubio insisted the united states was not seeking to dictate to venezuela   what unifies us today in this cause isn t interference in another country s affairs  but support for its people   he said  rubio said secretary of the treasury steve mnuchin had been involved in the issue  and that trump had spoken to secretary of state rex tillerson about venezuela this week  rubio said he had spoken to trump three times this month about venezuela and that he had spoken to vice president mike pence about it on thursday and earlier in the week as well   there is high level engagement throughout this administration on this issue   rubio said  \",\n          \"washington  reuters    president donald trump s pledge to bring massive investments in u s  infrastructure projects showed new signs of life on friday after lying dormant for weeks  as leading republican lawmakers said proposals from the administration could be in the offing  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  told reporters he expects to receive  some kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill  a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis   but gave no details or timing  he has previously voiced concern over adding to budget deficits with a new injection of federal funds for road  bridge and other construction projects like the ones president barack obama secured from congress in   especially after a major highway funding law was enacted about a year ago  some republicans and democrats in congress are increasingly criticizing trump s administration for being slow to get behind his legislative initiatives during the first month of his presidency  trump s plans to create an infrastructure council led by two new york billionaire friends  developers richard lefrak and steven roth  have yet to be launched  a spokesman for lefrak said   during his presidential campaign  trump said he would push for a   trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads  bridges  airports and other public works projects  he said he wanted action during the first  days of his administration  which now seems unlikely  the republican president has talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment in many of these projects  but democrats say that would fail to spur enough rebuilding and put taxpayers on the hook for a tax credit to wealthy developers  who they said would build toll roads that taxpayers would then have to pay to use  democrats want a more direct federal role in sparking a construction boom  in an interview on tuesday  republican representative mario diaz balart said he had  no doubt that it  infrastructure investment  is a priority for the administration   diaz balart chairs a house subcommittee that would control the flow of washington money that might be needed to fund some of the public works projects  several lawmakers and aides speculated the initiative could be attached to tax reform legislation that republicans want to advance this year  but no decisions have been made  writing an infrastructure bill involves seven or eight committees  there are complicated tax and spending questions at stake  and lawmakers are divided  there are also questions over what would qualify as an infrastructure project  with rural areas  for example  clamoring for more broadband internet service  senator john thune  a member of the republican leadership who chairs the commerce and transportation panel which has a say on any bill  said he had little information on the content or status of legislation  asked about mcconnell s comments  thune said   maybe he knows more about it since he s married to the secretary of transportation   elaine chao  \",\n          \"the move by a twitter employee last week to ban president trump from the social media platform for  minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like what did not get a great deal of attention  however  was the fact that twitter s acting general counsel  sean edgett  admitted in a prepared statement to the senate judiciary committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the clinton campaign and dnc in negative lights writing for newswars  jerome corsi notes at a hearing of the senate judiciary committee subcommittee on crime and terrorism on tuesday  sean edgett  acting general counsel for twitter  admitted in his prepared testimony that twitter employed in the  election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical  of  hillary clinton  including the hashtag  podestaemails and the hashtag  dncleaks  is anyone surprised twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even usa today brought it up  noting that twitter s behind the scenes team was quick to ban right wingers like milo yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever so entertaining actress leslie jones yet  conservatives say  nothing happened to rapper talib kweli and his followers when they attacked black breitbart reporter jerome hudson with racial slurs  when breitbart contributor kassy dillon complained about a twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages  twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot dillon in the head  now  the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to hrc and the dnc during the  election  the twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people  one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place  but that s a different matter   but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise for example  dr  corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the judiciary committee  edgett stated for example  our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated tweets promoting the  podestaemails hashtag  which originated with wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the clinton campaign chairman john podesta s gmail account  the core of the hashtag was propagated by wikileaks  whose account sent out a series of  original tweets containing variants on the hashtag  podestaemails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the wikileaks website so  automatically  what mr  edgett has admitted tells us that twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user  wikileaks  offering authentic information that wikileaks had published revealing real  confirmed e mails sourced from john podesta and the dnc  those e mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the dnc that worked against bernie sanders  campaign  and in favor of mrs  clinton s campaign  and later revealed extremely important information about what mrs  clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of syria and the underlying  unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of qaddafi in libya edgett also testified that twitter hid   of the   podestaemails  tweets  andas described in greater detail below  our systems detected and hid just under half     of the tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag   dncleak  which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the democratic national committee  those would be the e mails that revealed towering corruption at the dnc and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the clinton campaign to offer her easy questions  things like donna brazile  then an employee of cnn  feeding hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman  bernie sanders these are issues that were real  and the more people knew about them  the more they disliked mrs  clinton   and the more she and the dnc hackmeisters pushed the spurious  russia hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance for entire story  mrctv \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

funds to combat zika  a virus borne by mosquitoes that can cause microcephaly  a rare birth defect  but many republicans have said they need more information from the administration before approving the measure   in a temporary fix  the white house said earlier this month it would reprogram   million of allocated funds  but said this would be insufficient to deal with the threat  cochran  speaking at an appropriations committee meeting  did not say how much funding would be in the proposal  the republican said it would supplement the white house reallocation   we recognize that there
